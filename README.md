# Stock Market Price Prediction Project

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict stock market prices based on historical data using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks and deploying the solution as a real-time web application, this project offers insights into market trends, helping users make informed investment decisions.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Acquisition
We acquire historical stock market data using the **Yahoo Finance API**. This involves fetching time-series data containing features like opening price, closing price, high, low, and volume. Libraries such as `pandas_datareader` and `yfinance` are used for this purpose.

---

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensures the removal of irrelevant or noisy data and addresses any anomalies.  
- **Handling Missing Data**: Involves interpolation or imputation techniques to maintain the integrity of the dataset.  
- **Data Scaling**: Normalizes the dataset, which is crucial for neural network performance. For example, Min-Max Scaling is applied to bring values into the [0, 1] range.

### 3. Data Exploration
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is carried out to understand trends, correlations, and patterns in the dataset. Visualizations like line charts and correlation heatmaps are used to observe how the stock price changes over time and to identify influential features.

---

### 4. Trend Analysis with Moving Average
The **Moving Average (MA)** technique is applied to smooth time-series data and identify long-term trends. This helps in:  
- Detecting general market direction.  
- Comparing current performance with historical data.  
- Timing the market by identifying buy/sell signals based on crossover strategies (e.g., **Simple Moving Average vs. Exponential Moving Average**).

---

### 5. Model Creation
We design a machine learning model using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, incorporating the following layers:  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Captures sequential dependencies in time-series data, making it highly effective for stock price prediction.  
- **Dense**: Fully connected layers for prediction.  
- **Dropout**: Regularization technique to prevent overfitting.  

The model is trained on historical stock price data to predict the future closing price.

---

### 6. Model Testing
The trained model is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**. Test data is used to validate the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting unseen stock prices.

---

### 7. Deployment as a Web Application
A **Streamlit**-based web application is developed to enable real-time predictions and user interaction. Users can:  
- Input a stock ticker symbol.  
- Retrieve historical data.  
- View both the predicted and actual stock price trends in an intuitive interface.

---

## Features
- Real-time stock price retrieval and trend visualization.  
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and EDA for better model insights.  
- Advanced LSTM model optimized for time-series prediction.  
- Fully functional, user-friendly web application using **Streamlit**.

---

### Future Enhancements
- Incorporate more sophisticated models such as Transformer-based architectures.
- Add features like sentiment analysis of news articles affecting stock prices.
- Extend deployment to cloud platforms for wider accessibility.
